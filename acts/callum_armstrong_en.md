The British bagpiper Callum Armstrong will perform a selection of Piobaireachd (an art music genre associated primarily with the Scottish Highlands) tunes. In accordance to the traditional performance practice he will be performing in the outdoors. The following tunes are intended:

- "The Carles with the Breeks", a Piobaireachd which is based on a traditional tune.
- "Lament for the Viscount of Dundee", an irregular tune that begins by using all 9 notes, and then drops them over the course of the variations until only 4 remain.
- "The Desperate Battle of the Birds", the variations follow a common phrase pattern of AAB AB\*B AB. This tune is the only Piobaireachd that is believed to be programmatic, and is said to depict 2 eagles Fighting.
- "Beloved Scotland", an irregular Piobaireachd which uses all 9 notes of the pipe.

Callum Armstrong started playing the highland pipes at the age of 16. From then onwards music became the big passion in his life. After school he studied music at Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance in Greenwich, London. While at the Conservatoire he was awarded the Silver Medal for Early Music in 2013 and for three consecutive years the Beryl Maggs Prize for Recorder.

Once he left the Conservatoire, he began his career as a self-employed musician and composer, working in a wide variety of different musical fields. This musical journey has led him to many exciting areas as a performer, teacher and instrument maker. As a performer he works as a soloist, in duos like the Branschke Armstrong Duo, and ensembles like Concerto Caledonia and The Savage Prunes. He has also performed in theatre productions such as the Suppliant Woman, which toured around the UK and to Hong Kong.
