# FEED DRONE - a transmedia LECTURE PERFORMANCE
## with the New Music influencer [@winkler.works](https://www.instagram.com/deconstructed.stories/)

In accordance with the festival title 'Drone', the lecture performance will be designed as a continuum: Instagram as medium [@winkler.works](https://www.instagram.com/deconstructed.stories/) where it is pre-composed & further composed, and uses content-structural references of the other pieces presented at the yaÂ¹ festival.

By means of narrative-anticipatory swipe gestures, artificial intelligence and digital-spiritual intuition, audiovisual geometries are searched for in syllable sounds & carousel posts - and as soon as they are found, they are dismantled again. Who gets on the same drone twice?
