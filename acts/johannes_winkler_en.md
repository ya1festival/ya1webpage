# FEED DRONE - a transmedia LECTURE PERFORMANCE
## with the New Music influencer [@winkler.works](https://www.instagram.com/deconstructed.stories/)

In accordance with the festival title 'Drone', the lecture performance will be designed as a continuum: Instagram as medium [@winkler.works](https://www.instagram.com/deconstructed.stories/) where it is pre-composed & further composed, and uses content-structural references of the other pieces presented at the yaÂ¹ festival.

By means of narrative-anticipatory swipe gestures, artificial intelligence and digital-spiritual intuition, audiovisual geometries are searched for in syllable sounds & carousel posts - and as soon as they are found, they are dismantled again. Who gets on the same drone twice?

\*1984, lives and works as a freelance media artist and composer in Essen. His more recent work explores recursive relationships between 'counting and dreaming' and includes visual, auditory and conceptual works. Since 2017 he has been re-composing his wide-ranging oeuvre in lecture performances and audiovisual 'slide compositions' - as artistic research in images / films, text and music.

On Instagram, Johannes Winkler re-composes his oeuvre as audio-visual 'slide compositions'. Each post represents a multi-page work and is telling, documenting, anticipating - about the cybernetic everyday, metaphysics and aesthetics: people and art - people and numbers - people and nature - people and people. In order to keep them alive, the 'slide compositions' are deconstructed again in different contexts: e.g. in lectures and on his further Instagram accounts [@konnakol.de](https://www.instagram.com/konnakol.de/) [@deconstructed.stories](https://www.instagram.com/konnakol.de/) and [@wind.musik](https://www.instagram.com/wind.musik/).
