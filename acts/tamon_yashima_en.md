On the 6th of August, [Tamon Yashimas](https://www.tamonyashima.de/) dark ambient project will be heard. Influenced by the Japanese noise scene, he and the bassist [Jakob Krupp](https://www.instagram.com/jakobkrupp/?hl=en) will create an evening with a lot of sound pressure, low frequencies and lots of speakers.
