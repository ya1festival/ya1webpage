Her journey with music began in her early childhood, studying silver flute at different private schools and at the Conservatory in Milan.

At the age of 18 however she discovered the world of Indian Classical Music and from there on she completely immersed herself in this ancient art form.

At first, she studied at the Conservatory in Vicenza where a special course of Indian Classical Music exists since 2003. There she had the honour to study with [Amelia Juni](http://www.ameliacuni.de), Gianni Richizzi and Federico Sanesi.

In 2010 She graduated from this Conservatory in "tradizioni musicali extra europee ad indirizzo indologico" with the award for most outstanding graduates. She presented her final thesis after an extensive research in India interviewing great musicians and musicologists.

At the same time when she started the Conservatory in Vicenza she began her journey to India. At first, she studied the Bansuri (Indian flute) with [Pandit Rajendra Prasanna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajendra_Prasanna) in Delhi. However, she was drawn more and more to the most ancient form of Indian Classical Music of India Called ‘Dhrupad’ and she started studying with the [Gundecha Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gundecha_Brothers), foremost exponents of this genre. She lived in their school the ‘Dhrupad Sansthan’ in Bhopal for 6 months a year from 2009 to 2016.
