<h1>FEED DRONE - a transmedia LECTURE PERFORMANCE</h1>
<h2>with the New Music influencer <a href="https://www.instagram.com/deconstructed.stories/">@winkler.works</a></h2>
<p>In accordance with the festival title 'Drone', the lecture performance will be designed as a continuum: Instagram as medium <a href="https://www.instagram.com/deconstructed.stories/">@winkler.works</a> where it is pre-composed &amp; further composed, and uses content-structural references of the other pieces presented at the yaÂ¹ festival.</p>
<p>By means of narrative-anticipatory swipe gestures, artificial intelligence and digital-spiritual intuition, audiovisual geometries are searched for in syllable sounds &amp; carousel posts - and as soon as they are found, they are dismantled again. Who gets on the same drone twice?</p>
